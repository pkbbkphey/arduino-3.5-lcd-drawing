# hardware needed
First of all, I used an Arduino UNO for the basic of this project, and a 3.5" tft lcd module with touch screen (driver: ILI9488) is also needed.
# function
You can draw whatever you want on the tft screen, and then erase them. Also, it's a graphic editting system that could pick any color manually by adjusting the "RGB" percentage.

You should go to(FILE > EXAMPLES > MCUFRIEND_kbv > diagnose_Touchpins) to check out the pins of your touch screen
必須先到 (檔案 > 範例 > MCUFRIEND_kbv > diagnose_Touchpins) 來確認觸控螢幕的腳位序號是否正確，它會提示你程式碼裡面的應該改成什麼
