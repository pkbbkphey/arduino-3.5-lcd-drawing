# hardware needed
First of all, I used an Arduino UNO for the basic of this project, and a 3.5" tft lcd module with touch screen (driver: ILI9488) is also needed.
# function
You can draw whatever you want on the tft screen, and then erase them. Also, it's a graphic editting system that could pick any color manually by adjusting the "RGB" percentage.
